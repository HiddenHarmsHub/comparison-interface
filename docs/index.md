title: Introduction
---

The comparison interface is a web interface to facilitate the collection of comparative judgement data. It offers a 
highly configurable interface which requires at minimum a JSON configuration file and a set of image files as input. 
There is also the option to configure part of the system using a csv file.
The data is stored in an SQLite database which is part of the standard Python library so no additional database is required. 
There is no restriction regarding the nature of the items that can be compared in the software but it has been used 
previously on geospatial datasets to be processed with the [Bayesian Spatial Bradley--Terry model BSBT](https://github.com/rowlandseymour/BSBT).

The images presented to the user are selected in different ways depending on the configuration of the system.

1. Equally weighted pairs
    * Two random images from one of the selected groups or the full image set if only one group is defined.
    * Two random images from those items the user has knowledge of (these are selected in a pre-judging step also provided in the interface).
1. A pair of images selected in line with the weights assigned to the pair in the config file (the higher the weight the more likely the pair is to be presented).

Example configuration files for each of these models are provided with the application along with a small set of images.[^1]

This version of software expands over the initial application build by Bertrand Perrat that can be found [here](https://github.com/BPerrat/BSBT-Interface). The code in this version of the interface was written by Fabián Hernández with additional features and general updates by Catherine Smith in the Research Software Group, part of Advanced Research Computing, University of Birmingham.

## Getting Started

### Installation and example configurations

Instructions for installing the application and running the provided example configurations can be found on the
[installation page](installation.md). A number of different configuration files are provided in the repository. These
examples can be run to test an installation or evaluate the different modes available in the software. They can also
serve as good starting points for your own configurations. The example files themselves can be found in in the
comparison_interface/examples directory.

### Configuring the system

There are a few different ways that the system can be configured depending on the behaviour you need. Instructions for 
configuration can be found on the [configuration page](configuration.md) page.

### Testing

A number of different tests are provided in the repository. They are all run in the CI workflow. If you also want to 
run the tests locally you can find information on the dependencies and how to run the test on the [running the tests](testing.md) page.
